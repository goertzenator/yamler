# yamler, an Erlang YAML Loader

This application loads [YAML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaml) files into Erlang.  This implementation supports:

* Detailed errors on yaml load failures (line, column, reason)
* Anchors and aliases
* [Merge tags](http://yaml.org/type/merge.html)
* The tag `!atom` for explicitely tagging values as atoms.
* An `implicit_atoms` mode to interpret values that look atom-ish as atoms.
* Customizable schemas via callback modules.

This application embeds the C yaml parser "[libyaml](http://pyyaml.org/wiki/LibYAML)" which is compiled as a NIF.

# Installation

### Download

Download the code...

	$ git clone git://github.com/goertzenator/yamler.git

**Note**: you might also need to install
[libyaml](http://pyyaml.org/wiki/LibYAML), the underlying C library.

### Compile

Build the source and documentation and run tests with ...

	$ cd yamler
	$ rebar compile doc eunit

Play with it..

	$ export ERL_LIBS=$(pwd)
	$ erl
	Erlang R15B01 (erts-5.9.1) [source] [64-bit] [smp:3:3] [async-threads:0] [kernel-poll:false]

	Eshell V5.9.1  (abort with ^G)
	1> yaml:load_file("test/yaml/demo1.yaml").
	{ok,[[{<<"specialDelivery">>,
	       <<"Follow the Yellow Brick Road to the Emerald City. Pay no attention to the man 	behind the cur"...>>},
	      {<<"items">>, ...



# Schemas

Tag resolution and value construction are implemented in *schema callback modules*.  This application includes 4 different schema callback modules, and others can be implemented if different behavior is required.

The included schemas are:

* `yaml_schema_failsafe`
* `yaml_schema_json`
* `yaml_schema_core`
* `yaml_schame_erlang` (default)

The schema is selected with the `schema` option, for example:

	4> yaml:load_file("test/yaml/demo1.yaml", [{schema, yaml_schema_core}]).
	{ok,[[{<<"specialDelivery">>, ...



`failsafe` and `json` are defined by the yaml spec.  They are of limited use, however the schema modules can be instructive if you want to write your own.

The `core` schema (defined by the yaml spec) has most of what you need to make good use of yaml.  The `erlang` schema extends core with [merge](http://yaml.org/type/merge.html) and atom support.

To explicitely tag a value as an atom, use the `!atom` tag, for example:

	- !atom an_atom
	- !atom yet another atom

To turn on implicit atom detection for untagged values, use the erlang schema and pass in the `implicit_atoms` options, for example:

	5> yaml:load_file("test/yaml/demo1.yaml", [implicit_atoms]).

The following yaml fragment illustrates which values will be recognized as atoms:

	- "not an atom"
	- not an atom
	- 'an atom'
	- an_atom
	- anatom
	- aNA_t@OM@_
	- Not_an_atom
	- Notanatom
	- "not_an_atom"


## Custom Schemas

See the behavior documenation for yaml_schema and the 4 schemas included in this application.

# Tips

If you are using erlide, I recommend the eclipse yaml editor [yedit](http://code.google.com/p/yedit/).

# Limitations

* This app does not emit yaml.
* This app may stumble on enormous yaml files because the entire file, event stream, and constructed documents must fit in memory at once.  Also, a scheduler may be stuck in a NIF call for a while when parsing a very large yaml file.
